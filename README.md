Started this GitHub account to get some hands-on experience with GitHub and to store/display my final project for the Data Analytics program at Coursera by Google. 


ðŸ”­ I'm also working with sports data as a side project. Currently looking for efficient ways to gather and organize that type of data. Any collaborations, help, or suggestions are welcome!
